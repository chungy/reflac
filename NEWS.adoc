1.5 (2017-08-16)
----------------

  * reflac has learned to preserve an embedded image in FLAC files.
    Limited to just one image for now, but should cover the most
    common case.


1.4 (2016-09-16)
----------------

  * Add an option to preserve the file modification time.

1.3 (2016-09-25)
----------------

  * Use the rf64 format during processing, eliminating the 4GiB
    uncompressed file size limit.  This is primarily useful for FLACs
    with lots of channels (eg, surround sound) and high sample sizes
    and rates, as the 4GiB limit isn’t otherwise likely to be hit.

1.2.3 (2016-07-10)
------------------

  * Actually bump the script’s own version identifier.

1.2.2 (2016-07-10)
------------------

  * The first bash in the $PATH is used instead of /bin/bash
  * Shift temporary directory creation after getopt.  reflac won’t
    leave one around anymore after ambiguous options (such as “--v”
    expanding to both “--verbose” and “--version”).

1.2.1 (2016-04-28)
------------------

  * Remove the temporary directory also after using `--version`

1.2 (2016-04-28)
----------------

  * Sync data by default, add `--no-sync` to disable.  The new
    versions of FLACs files are written out to prevent
    missing/incomplete files in the face of a crash.

1.1 (2016-04-25)
----------------

  * Add `--no-action`, enabling the view of files that would be
    processed.
  * Secure against using `--recursive` and directory names beginning
    with hyphens.
  * Displays usage help if no directories are specified on the command
    line.
  * Use a temporary staging directory, avoiding the possibility of
    losing all existing tag data in the face of errors.

1.0 (2016-04-17):
-----------------

  * Use the so-called “bash strict mode” and enable better processing
    of special file names.

0.2 (2015-05-18):
-----------------

  * Added a recursive option, allowing a whole tree to be
    recompressed.

0.1 (2014-02-26):
-----------------

  * Initial release, expanded from a ~7 line script the author
    initially wrote around 2003.
