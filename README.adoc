reflac
======

This is a small shell script that can recompress FLAC files while
preserving all the tagging information. It is safe to use on files
with special characters in their names.

Usage
-----

Running it is simple: `reflac [OPTION]... [--] DIRECTORY...`

One or more directories must be specified, the double-hyphen being
supported so that you can terminate the options list and enter
directory names that begin with a hypen. See the manual page
(+reflac.adoc+ in the source) for details.
