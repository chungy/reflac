reflac
======

This is a small shell script that can recompress FLAC files while
preserving all the tagging information. It is safe to use on files
with special characters in their names.

Usage
-----

Running it is simple: `reflac [OPTION]... [--] DIRECTORY...`

One or more directories must be specified (okay, technically you can
have none, but the program exits immediately!), the double-hyphen
being supported so that you can terminate the options list and enter
directory names that begin with a hypen.

There are only a few options for it, mainly:

--verbose, -v::
Used once, it displays the file names as they are being
processed. Used twice, the full standard output of the `flac` command
is displayed.

-0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, --fast, --best::
Selects the compression level for `flac`, the default being +-5+. Like
the `flac` command itself, +--fast+ and +--best+ are synonyms for +-0+
and +-8+ respectively.
