reflac.sh
=========

This is a small shell script that can recompress FLAC files while
preserving all the tagging information. It is safe to use on files
with special characters (spaces, $s, etc) in them. Presently, it takes
no options, it recompresses FLAC files with -8, the highest
compression available. Just run it in a directory full of FLACs you
want recompressed.
