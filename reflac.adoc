NAME
----
reflac - recompress FLAC files

SYNOPSIS
--------
*reflac* ['OPTIONS'...] ['--'] 'DIRECTORY'...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
reflac recompresses FLAC files while preserving all of their tags. It
should always be safe to run, it handles cases of special file names
well, allowing odd characters such as *, ?, |, and so on. To use on a
directory that itself begins with a hyphen, you should use the '--'
argument, it will terminate the options list and intepret all further
arguments as directory names.

*-h*, *--help*::
Displays a usage summary and brief help descriptions.

*-v*, *--verbose*::
reflac will keep quiet in normal operation, keeping to the Rule of
Silence. Specifying this option once will display the directory names
it enters and each file name processed. Specifying this option twice
will display the entire output of *flac*, including the progress of
each individual file.

*-0*, *--fast*::

Passes *-0* onto the *flac* command. This is the least attainable
compression possible, and it is also the least CPU-intensive for both
encoding and decoding.

*-1*, *-2*, *-3*, *-4*, *-5*, *-6*, *-7*::
Passes the selected compression level to FLAC, higher numbers being
more compressed but also more CPU-intensive on encoding and
decoding. The default for reflac is *-5*, the same as *flac* itself.

*-8*, *--best*::
Passes *-8* onto the *flac* command. This is the highest attainable
compression possible, and it is also the most CPU-intensive for both
encoding and decoding. Real-time playback may not be possible on some
embedded-type systems, such as Blu-ray players or portable music
players.
